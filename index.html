				<p>
					On the night of May 31, 2020, a week after the death of
					George Floyd, crowds of people took to the streets in
					downtown Boston to protest against police brutality.
				</p>
				<p>
					Peaceful demonstrations turned violent as the night went on,
					while police officers went out in force to control the
					situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					News outlets and witnesses widely reported there was an
					extensive use of tear gas, pepper spray and physical
					violence by the police.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Appeal, an online news and commentary website about the
					legal and social justice system, exclusively obtained a copy
					of Boston Police officers’ body camera footage on the night
					of May 31.
				</p>
				<p>
					In December 2020, The Appeal reported that those footage
					showed “police officers bragging about attacking protesters
					and multiple instances of excessive force and the liberal
					use of pepper spray.”
