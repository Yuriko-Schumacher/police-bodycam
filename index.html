					On the night of May 31, 2020, a week after the death of
					George Floyd, crowds of people took to the streets in
					downtown Boston to protest against police brutality.

					Peaceful demonstrations turned into violent clashes as the
					night went on, with news outlets and witnesses reporting an
					extensive use of tear gas, pepper spray and physical
					violence by the police.
